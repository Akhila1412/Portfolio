# Portfolio
This project involves creating a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills, accomplishments, projects, and experiences to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. The website will have a clean and professional design, ensuring easy navigation and clear presentation of information.

The home page will introduce visitors to the website and provide a brief overview of who I am and what I do. It will include a welcome message, a professional photo, and links to other sections of the website.

In the "About Me" section, visitors will find more detailed information about myself, including my background, education, skills, and professional experience. This will give them a better understanding of my qualifications and expertise.

The portfolio section will showcase some of my past projects, including descriptions, images, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories. This will allow visitors to see examples of my work and assess my abilities.

In the skills section, I will list my technical skills and areas of expertise. This will help visitors understand the specific skills and technologies that I bring to the table.

The contact page will provide visitors with a way to get in touch with me. It will include a contact form where they can send me a message, as well as links to my social media profiles and professional email address.

The website will have a clean and modern design, with a consistent color scheme and typography throughout. It will be fully responsive, ensuring that it looks good and functions correctly on devices of all sizes, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. I will use CSS to add visual effects and animations to make the website more engaging and interactive, without sacrificing usability.

I will start by outlining the structure and content of the website, including the pages and sections that I want to include. Then, I will create the basic structure of the website using HTML, including the necessary tags and elements for each section. Next, I will use CSS to style the website, including layout, typography, colors, and visual effects. I will ensure that the website looks good and functions correctly on devices of all sizes by using CSS media queries and flexible layouts. After thorough testing on different devices and web browsers, I will deploy the website to a web hosting service and make it live for visitors to access.

Creating a personal portfolio website is an essential step for showcasing my skills and accomplishments to potential employers or clients. By following this detailed project plan and utilizing HTML and CSS, I aim to create a professional and visually appealing website that effectively communicates my qualifications and expertise.
